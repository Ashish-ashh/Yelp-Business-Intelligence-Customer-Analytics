## 📂 Dataset Description

The analysis uses multiple datasets from the Yelp Academic Dataset:

| Dataset  | Description                                                      |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Business | Business details such as name, location, ratings, and categories |
| Review   | Customer reviews and rating information                          |
| User     | User activity metrics and engagement data                        |
| Check-in | Business visit frequency                                         |
| Tip      | Short customer feedback                                          |

A subset of the dataset was used to ensure efficient computation within system limitations.

## 🔄 Project Workflow

The project follows a structured end-to-end analytics pipeline:

### 1️⃣ Data Collection & Loading

* Imported JSON datasets into Python using Pandas
* Converted semi-structured data into tabular format
* Selected relevant columns for analysis

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

* Removed duplicates
* Handled missing values
* Standardized data formats
* Filtered meaningful business records
* Reduced dataset size for efficient processing

### 3️⃣ Database Creation & SQL Integration

* Created a relational database using SQLite
* Loaded cleaned datasets into SQL tables
* Performed joins between datasets to enable multi-dimensional analysis
* Executed SQL queries to extract business insights

This step demonstrates real-world data analyst workflow where SQL is used for querying large datasets.

### 4️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed statistical and exploratory analysis to understand:

* Distribution of business ratings
* Review count trends
* User engagement behavior
* City-wise business concentration
* Check-in activity patterns

### 5️⃣ Data Visualization

Visualizations were created using Python libraries to communicate insights clearly.

Key visualizations include:

* Ratings distribution plots
* Top performing businesses
* Customer engagement trends
* Location-based analysis
* Review count vs rating relationships
